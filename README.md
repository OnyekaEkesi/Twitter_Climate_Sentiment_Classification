# Twitter Climate Sentiment Classification

## Project Description

In this project, We developed a tool that can be used to analyze tweets and identify whether the sentiment of the tweet is positive, negative, or neutral. This tool can be used by companies to understand how the public perceives climate change and how their products or services might be perceived in the context of climate sentiment.

We tested different machine learning models to find the best one for predicting climate sentiment in tweets. The Linear SVM was the best performing model giving an F1 score of 0.80. We also considered other metrics such as Accuracy, Recall and Precision.

## features
This project presents a sentiment analysis tool for tweets that can classify them as positive, negative, news, or neutral. The tool is implemented as a web application using Streamlit, which makes it easy to use and interact with.
The web application allows users to analyse tweets which it takes in as text and it returns sentiment of the tweet. This makes it ideal for organizations that need to analyze the sentiment of a large number of tweets.
